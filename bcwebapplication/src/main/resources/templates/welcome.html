<h1>Welcome, Customer!</h1>
<h4>BookCrossing (also BC, BCing or BXing) is defined as "the practice of leaving a book in a public place to be picked up and read by others, who then do likewise."</h4>
<h4>Although, we don't leave your book in a public place, it is delivered to a special box, which saves the value of the book and makes it more comfortable for You.</h4>
<h4>We also believe it is a huge step towards conscious consumption.</h4>
<h4>Thank You for choosing us!</h4>
